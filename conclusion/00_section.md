# Conclusions

* Not only for OpenStack
* Transparency
* Set expectations
* Call to action

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
The OpenStack way is not specific to OpenStack or the OpenStack Foundation.
It cares a lot about transparency and being community driven, but you need to
be aware that comes with a cost.

If you are going to embrace this model make sure to set expectation rights,
to avoid frustration to yourself, sponsors and contributors.

The model where a company takes a number of engineers and put them on an
opensource project for a very tightly limited amount of time and expect a
feature in return, and them move them to the next thing abruptly does not
really work.

It takes time and commitment to contribute to a community, contributors
should work on things that are relevant for the community as well as what's
relevant for their employers to be successful.
