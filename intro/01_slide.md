The community evolved over the years, in size, in governance.

The OpenStack foundation was created to provide shared resources to projects,
promote OpenStack projects and the community around them.

The definition of what an OpenStack project is evolved over time as well.
With the big tent, a project must follow the principles of the OpenStack
community and it's tagged to describe its state of maturity.
