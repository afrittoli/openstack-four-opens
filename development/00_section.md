~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Open development refers to the development workflow and processes.

We use gerrit for code review. Most teams adopt company diversity policies to
avoid contributions to be driven by a single company.

Out tools are hosted on git.openstack.org. They are maintained by "horizontal" teams, and everyone is welcome to contribute.

Configuration management for our services is on git.openstack.org, and in fact
many companies used the same tools for their downstream CI and helped
maintain the tools and services and their configuration management.
