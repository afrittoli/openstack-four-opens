* Community Lead QA
* Minimum QA requirement
* Tools and frameworks with plugins

* No centrally defined test plan or strategy

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
The QA effort is community driven.

The community defines minimum testing requirements for a project to be included
in a release (TBD link to the document) and gain certain "tags", e.g.
"support upgrades". Tags help users and operators to understand the level of
maturity of a project.

The deployment system (devstack) and test frameworks (tempest and grenade)
include a plugin mechanism, so that the horizontal team do not provide a
bottleneck. Project team maintain their plugins according to their needs.
