~~~SECTION:notes~~~
One of the aspects of open design is to know what to expect from a project.
In OpenStack we do specifications as code. Reviews happens in gerrit and
once approved the spec is published to a web site.

During the release cycle we have a spec freeze and we fix what may become
part of the next release.

We also have a tool for release notes automation.
Release notes are created incrementally as part of any commit that has an
impact in terms of upgrade, new features, changes to APIs, bug fixes.

At the OpenStack summit we have "project updates" presentations, which
highlight what's new in the coming release and give an overlook about what
may be coming in future releases. Those presentations are recorded and
available on youtube (which is not open source).
