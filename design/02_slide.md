~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Having an open design approach has a drawback.
Anyone can contribute to the design, bring its own uses cases to the table.
This means it's harder to say no to features, which means you may end up
with more but less integrated / tested features.

The spec freeze limits the time window during which new features may be
proposed, but that too has the downside of forcing a 6months+ delay to features
that miss the window.
